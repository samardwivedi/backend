# Project Report: Helpora Web Application

## 1. Project Overview
Helpora is a web-based platform designed to connect volunteers with individuals seeking assistance in various domains such as healthcare, home services, and more. The application aims to streamline the process of finding and offering help, making community support more accessible and efficient.

## 2. Objectives
- Facilitate easy connection between volunteers and those in need.
- Provide a secure and user-friendly interface for both volunteers and requesters.
- Enable real-time communication and notifications.
- Support payment and review systems for transparency and trust.

## 3. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication
- **Email Service:** Nodemailer (with Gmail App Passwords)
- **Payment Integration:** Stripe

## 4. Folder Structure
- `my-auth-app/` – Frontend React application
  - `src/components/` – Reusable UI components
  - `src/pages/` – Main pages (About, Contact, Dashboard, etc.)
  - `src/contexts/` – Context API for state management
- `backend/` – Backend Node.js/Express server
  - `models/` – Mongoose models for MongoDB collections
  - `routes/` – API endpoints for different modules
  - `middleware/` – Authentication and other middleware
  - `utils/` – Utility functions (email, chatbot, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Backend test scripts

## 5. Key Features

## 6. Security & Best Practices
- Environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, DB credentials)
- JWT for secure authentication
- Input validation and error handling in backend routes
- Use of HTTPS (recommended for deployment)

## 7. Notable Implementation Details
- Modular code structure for scalability
- Use of React Context for theme and global state
- Integration with third-party services (Stripe, Gmail)
- Batch scripts for setup and database seeding

## 8. Possible Improvements / Future Work
- Add more granular user roles and permissions
- Implement push notifications
- Enhance accessibility and mobile responsiveness
- Add automated frontend testing

## 9. Conclusion
Helpora demonstrates a full-stack approach to solving real-world problems using modern web technologies. The project emphasizes modularity, security, and user experience, making it a strong candidate for further development and deployment.
